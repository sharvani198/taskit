This is a basic MERN app.

After cloning the repo, please run ```npm install``` in both the client and server folders.
* ```(cd server && npm install)```
* ```(cd client && npm install)```

To run the app both the client and server need to be started as:
1. ```(cd server && npm start)```
2. ```(cd client && npm start)```

Right now it connects to a mongo running in the cloud so no need to host one locally for now.
